  <title>Migrating from libtracker-control 1.x to 2.0</title>

  <para>
    Tracker 2.0 is a new major version, containing some possibly
    incompatible changes. Most of the changes are not hard to adapt,
    and even unlikely to be a problem if the ported application was
    kept up-to-date in its usage of 1.x.

    <para>
      The tracker_miner_manager_index_file method now requires a GCancellable
      argument. You can pass NULL if you don't want to specify one.
