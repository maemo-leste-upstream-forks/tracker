.SH NAME
tracker-writeback.cfg

.SH SYNOPSIS
$HOME/.config/tracker/tracker-writeback.cfg

.SH DESCRIPTION
Tracker's configuration is built on top of GSettings, part of GLib. This means that there is a proper schema for configurations and they can be viewed (normally) using the \fBdconf-editor\fR tool.

Tracker also allows switching from the GSettings database, used by most (cross) desktop applications, to a key/value formatted files (like Microsoft's INI format). To do this, the environment variable \fBTRACKER_USE_CONFIG_FILES\fR must be defined before running the application using that configuration.

So where is this configuration? Well, normally they're stored in \fI$HOME/.config/tracker/\fR, however, default values are not stored to config files, only \fBdifferent\fR values are. This man page describes what keys and values can be used.

See EXAMPLES for a general overview.
